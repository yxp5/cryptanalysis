# Vigenere Cipher Attack
Simple, and yet not optimized algorithm to decrypt Vigenere cipher text using letter frequency analysis (by http://inventwithpython.com/hacking (BSD Licensed))

# Usage
-> Run in terminal, prepare cipher text in a text file
-> Import to another python program using [import vigenere] and use [vigenereBreak(cipher_text:str, PRINT:bool)] to perform the decryption
-> Include a test case in [cipher_text.txt]

# Further work
-> Multi-trial attack in case of multiple potential key
